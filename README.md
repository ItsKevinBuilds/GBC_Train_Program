# LEGO Great Ball Contraption Train

This project is a fully automated LEGO Great Ball Contraption (GBC) train system, programmed using Pybricks on a LEGO Technic Hub. The train is designed to transport balls between GBC modules, with an integrated color sensor for precise control, a motorized dumping mechanism, and Bluetooth communication.

## Overview

The LEGO GBC Train is an essential component of a Great Ball Contraption, designed to move balls between different modules. This train system is powered by a LEGO Technic Hub and includes advanced features such as color detection, motor control, and real-time data broadcasting via Bluetooth.

## Features

- **Automated Train Movement**: The train moves along a predefined path, controlled by a DC motor.
- **Color Detection**: A Color Distance Sensor is used to detect specific colors along the path, ensuring precise stopping points.
- **Dumping Mechanism**: A motorized dumping system automatically unloads balls at the destination.
- **Bluetooth Communication**: The system broadcasts key data, such as motor speed, over Bluetooth.
- **Dynamic Load Timing**: The load time is calculated based on the train's return trip duration, optimizing the system's efficiency.

## Hardware Setup

To build this GBC train system, you'll need the following LEGO components:

- **Technic Hub**: The central control unit of the system.
- **DC Motor**: Controls the movement of the train (connected to Port A).
- **Technic Motor**: Powers the dumping mechanism (connected to Port B).
- **Color Distance Sensor**: Detects colors to control train stops (connected to Port C).
- **Light**: Used as train headlights (connected to Port D).
- **LEGO Technic pieces**: Various parts for building the train structure and dumping mechanism.

## Software Setup

1. **Install Pybricks**: Ensure that Pybricks is installed on your LEGO Technic Hub. You can find installation instructions on the [Pybricks website](https://pybricks.com/).
2. **Upload Code**: Upload the provided Python code to your Technic Hub using Pybricks IDE or any other compatible tool.
3. **Pairing with Bluetooth**: The hub will broadcast data via Bluetooth, so ensure your receiving device is paired and ready to receive the broadcast.

## Operation Guide

1. **Start the System**: Place the train on the track and power on the Technic Hub.
2. **Monitor the Train**: The train will start moving, detecting color markers to control its operation.
3. **Dumping Mechanism**: When the train reaches the destination, the dumping mechanism will activate, unloading the balls.
4. **Data Broadcasting**: Throughout the operation, the train broadcasts motor speed data over Bluetooth, which can be monitored in real-time.

## Code Explanation

- **Initialization**: The devices are initialized, including the DC motor for the train, the motor for dumping, the color sensor, and the headlights.
- **wait_for_color(desired_color)**: This function halts the train until the desired color is detected by the sensor.
- **time_return_trip()**: This function times the train's return trip, controlling the motor based on color detection and returns the duration.
- **calculate_load_time(return_time)**: Calculates the optimal load time based on the return trip duration.
- **Main Program Loop**: Continuously controls the train's operation, including moving, stopping, and dumping balls based on color detection and timing calculations.

## Troubleshooting

- **Train Not Moving**: Ensure the DC motor is properly connected and the battery is charged.
- **Color Detection Issues**: Check the alignment of the Color Distance Sensor with the track markers.
- **Bluetooth Issues**: Verify that the Technic Hub is properly paired with your receiving device.
